These three files store the code for the vertical line, horizontal line and polyline pattern.
These correspond to the three basic pigment patterns of the shell.
1. Lines perpendicular to the edge: stable in time. The activator content is relatively large.

2. Lines parallel to the edge: oscillations in time. The inhibitor content is relatively large.

3. Oblique lines: traveling waves. The inhibitor propagates slowly and the spatial content is random.

4.par-ra-1.ipynb & 5.par-ra-2.ipynb simulate the effects of different parameters on the pattern. 
The activator - substrate model (the same equation) can simulate the above three patterns with different parameters.

6.^>^.ipynb adds global control. 
The program generated one of my favorite spatial patterns, which was also the first pattern simulation I made.

7.^>^par-ra-1.ipynb simulates the effect of a parameter on the pattern.

Thanks to Hans Meinhardt, the author of The-Algorithmic-Beauty-of-Sea-Shells.

I will update more simulations if I am free.
